# CM-CASL
Comparison-based Performance Modeling of Software Systems via Collaborative Active and Semisupervised Learning

An integration of AL and SSL is adopted in CM-CASL to perform collaborative labeling by both human experts and the classifier itself. AL achieves good prediction results by improving the quality of the training samples. It obtains high-quality samples by selecting effective samples iteratively using a query strategy for human labeling, which balances between informativeness and representativeness. Different from AL, SSL pays more attention to unlabeled samples in an unsupervised manner. It enhances the classifier by increasing the number of training samples, and improves the generalization of the classifier. However, the performance of SSL would depend on the informativeness and reliability of pseudolabeling. To address this issue, CM-CASL employs an AL-based verification scheme to improve the accuracy of pseudolabeling. Furthermore, the unlabeled samples at median distances are considered more informative and therefore are assigned with pseudolabels. As a result, the samples with more information and credible pseudolabels are added to increase the quantity of training samples, hence further improving the prediction performance.
